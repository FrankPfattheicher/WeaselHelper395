# WeaselHelper395

"If your specifications are ambiguous, the greater the ambiguity, the easier the specifications are to satisfy (if the specifications are absolutely ambiguous, every program will satisfy them!"    
Edsger Dijkstra https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html


## In The Beginning
### Inspiration
Project trying to follow @pro_cessor's three universal rules for good code: 

* Rule A: Good names
* Rule Alpha: Many small units
* Rule Aleph: Tests

The rules aren't ordinal (hence a-aleph), but interact. Small units are easy to name and test. Good names favor small units. They work in every language.

### Initial Steps
Can't start Project.     
Still thinking about a good name...

### First Input
Call it a weasel, rename it later. Just make sure to keep everything small, and decomposed, but composable.

### First Requirements
As in many other projects there are buzzword driven requirements added from totally clueless bystanders.
